Hussain AlSalem is a Geophysics PhD candidate at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). He received his
undergraduate degree in geophysics
from University of Leeds and completed his Master's studies from UC Berkeley. At UC Berkeley, he also completed
two minors in the [Computational and Data Science and Engineering Program](http://citris-uc.org/decse-mission/)
and Numerical Analysis.

At UC Berkeley, he became proficient in using many programming languages and scientific tools such as Fortran,
Python, Java, C, MATLAB, MPI and OpenMP computing and Petsc. He heavily used these tools for his Master's and PhD
theses at UC Berkeley. 

His research interests are at the interface between geophysics and high performance computing (HPC): using
and developing efficient computational-based methodology to solve complex geophysical problems such as
forward modelling the wave equation and full waveform inversion. He works on parallel computation, data analysis,
computational modelling, and visualisation of scientific data sets.

Current projects include adding topography, implementing
adaptive meshes, and analysing different parallel preconditioners
and solvers for the forward modelling of the 3D acoustic wave equation.
