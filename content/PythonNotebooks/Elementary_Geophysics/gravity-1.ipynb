    "## Basic Concept\n",
    "Lateral density changes in the subsurface cause a change in the force of gravity at the surface. The intensity of the force of gravity due to a buried mass difference (concentration or void) is superimposed on the larger force of gravity due to the total mass of the earth. Thus, two components of gravity forces are measured at the Earth's surface: first, a general and relatively uniform component due to the total earth, and second, a component of much smaller size that varies due to lateral density changes (the gravity anomaly).  By very precise measurement of gravity and by careful correction for variations in the larger component due to the whole Earth, a gravity survey can sometimes detect natural or man-made voids, variations in the depth to bedrock, and geologic structures of engineering interest.\n",
